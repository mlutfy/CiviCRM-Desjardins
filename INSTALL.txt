View the README.txt for general information about this module before installing.

REQUIREMENTS:
------------

* The "curl" PHP library. Under Debian, apt-get install php5-curl.
  This library is necessary for when communicating credit card information
  with the payment gateway.

* The 'extensions' subdirectory must be writable by the web server (this is a civicrm requirement).

INSTALLATION:
------------

* Enable this module in Drupal, then enable the extention in CiviCRM.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > CiviMail > Message templates (/civicrm/admin/messageTemplates?reset=1),
  go to the "System messages" subtab. Edit the "Contributions - Receipt (on-line)" template
  and add the token "Desjardins CC receipt", i.e. {contribution.desjardins_receipt} in the 
  "credit card information" section of the template (both HTML and text formats).

* In the receipt template, add a section with the "Terms and conditions", including
  your privacy policy, shipping fees (even if there are none) and refund policy.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > Configure > Domain information (civicrm/admin/domain?action=update&reset=1),
  make sure you have set correct values for the organisation name, e-mail and postal address.

CAVEATS:
-------

* This module overrides your extension directory. (maybe we ought to find a better solution?)

View the README.txt for general information about this module before installing.

REQUIREMENTS:
------------

* The "curl" PHP library. Under Debian, apt-get install php5-curl.
  This library is necessary for when communicating credit card information
  with the payment gateway.

* The 'extensions' subdirectory must be writable by the web server (this is a civicrm requirement).

INSTALLATION:
------------

* Enable this module in Drupal, then enable the extention in CiviCRM.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > CiviMail > Message templates (/civicrm/admin/messageTemplates?reset=1),
  go to the "System messages" subtab. Edit the "Contributions - Receipt (on-line)" template
  and add the token "Desjardins CC receipt", i.e. {contribution.desjardins_receipt} in the 
  "credit card information" section of the template (both HTML and text formats).

* In the receipt template, add a section with the "Terms and conditions", including
  your privacy policy, shipping fees (even if there are none) and refund policy.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > Configure > Domain information (civicrm/admin/domain?action=update&reset=1),
  make sure you have set correct values for the organisation name, e-mail and postal address.

* Create a custom field for contribution with a checkbox field "Terms and conditions". Include
  it in a footer profile for the contribution page, and make it mandatory. The help text for
  the field should link (and open in a new window) to your site's terms and conditions (site
  privacy policy, terms of use, refund/cancellation policy, shipping policy).

* In each contribution form, configure the "receipt text" so that it displays your organisation
  name, postal address, phone number and e-mail. It should also include a footer text with a
  link to your website's terms and conditions, as well as explicitely mention the refund
  policy (even if only "all transactions are final, no refunds").

CAVEATS:
-------

* This module overrides your extension directory. (maybe we ought to find a better solution?)

View the README.txt for general information about this module before installing.

REQUIREMENTS:
------------

* The "curl" PHP library. Under Debian, apt-get install php5-curl.
  This library is necessary for when communicating credit card information
  with the payment gateway.

* The 'extensions' subdirectory must be writable by the web server (this is a civicrm requirement).

INSTALLATION:
------------

* Enable this module in Drupal, then enable the extention in CiviCRM.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > CiviMail > Message templates (/civicrm/admin/messageTemplates?reset=1),
  go to the "System messages" subtab. Edit the "Contributions - Receipt (on-line)" template
  and add the token "Desjardins CC receipt", i.e. {contribution.desjardins_receipt} in the 
  "credit card information" section of the template (both HTML and text formats).

* In the receipt template, add a section with the "Terms and conditions", including
  your privacy policy, shipping fees (even if there are none) and refund policy.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > Configure > Domain information (civicrm/admin/domain?action=update&reset=1),
  make sure you have set correct values for the organisation name, e-mail and postal address.

* Create a custom field for contribution with a checkbox field "Terms and conditions" (ToS). 
  Include it in a footer profile for the contribution page, and make it mandatory. The help 
  text for the field should link (and open in a new window) to your site's terms and conditions
  (site privacy policy, terms of use, refund/cancellation policy, shipping policy).

* Set the civicrmdesjardins_tos_url and civicrmdesjardins_tos_text variables, with respectively
  the URL to your ToS and the description of your refund policy. This is not mandatory, but
  otherwise you will have to add it manually to your receipt footer.
  There is no UI for this yet, use drush vset.

CAVEATS:
-------

* This module overrides your extension directory. (maybe we ought to find a better solution?)
